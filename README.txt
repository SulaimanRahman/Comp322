This Program reads input from the user. if the user enters a directory to a file, it will read that file, and it will get the binary numbers from it, and if the user enters binary numbers then it will just read those binary numbers, then if the binary number length is less than 8 it will add zeros to its end and then the program converts the binary number to decimal, it notes the decimal number, and then converts the decimal number to ASCII value. Also, it checks the parity of the binary numbers, if it's even or odd. After all of that, it prints the binary number, then the ASCII of that binary number, then the decimal number of that binary Number, and at last its parity.
